        <h2>What's an Driving Test</h2><br>
        <p>A driving test is a procedure designed to evaluate a person's ability to operate a motor vehicle such as a
            passenger car, motorcycle, or commercial vehicle.
            Passing a driving test is usually one of the requirements for obtaining a driver license.The driving test
            usually consists of two parts: a online knowledge
            test with multiple choice questions to evaluate a person's knowledge of driving-related rules and laws, and
            a practical behind-the-wheel test (sometimes called a
            road test or skill test) to assess the person's ability to drive safely. The online test covers the
            information found in the official Driver License Manual,
            including road rules, traffic laws and signs, fines, limits, and safe driving practices.</p>
